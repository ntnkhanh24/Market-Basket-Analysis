# Market-Basket-Analysis

This dataset contains 9835 grocery transactions with detail of each item in the transaction.
For this project, we will:
1) Plot the 20 most frequent items in the dataset.
2) Get frequent itemsets that have a minimum support of 0.001
3) Obtain the rules for the itemsets obtained in step 2 and display them in descending order by lift.
